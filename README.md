### üßæ Description
Simple python program using simple heuristic algorithm to detect some potential malwares files. In other hand, it could be hard to analyze whether the malware file extension is easy to guess or not. It needs take time if find potential malware files manually. The objective of program is KISS (Keep it Simple as Stupid) that everyone can easily use the program free and open-source.

### üìä Comparison
The program rely on one of python modules called `os` and it's not better way if compared to another program based on heuristic algorithm. I've created another python program that only rely on linux terminal called `find` and it's better in speed comparision. The program rely on linux terminal won on complexity finding malicious files than my main program that rely on python modules `os`. But, the goal for the heuristic algorithm is just how to solve the problems using Rules of thumb that guide the search for a `good enough` solution quickly, more flexible and efficient for complex problems.
